Setup is pretty straight forward. The base directory is assumed to be the place where the repository is saved in your computer.
1. Have python3 and virtualenv installed

4. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python3 -i tetra.py` or `python3 -i 'Symbolic Tetra.py'` depending on which modules you want to use.
